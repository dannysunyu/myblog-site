第一章：绪论    

An agent is just something that acts.    
A rational agent is one that acts so as to achieve the
best outcome or, when there is uncertainty, the best expected outcome.    

The rational-agent approach to AI has prevailed throughout most of the field’s history. In the early decades, rational 
agents were built on logical foundations and formed definite plans to achieve specific goals. Later, methods based on 
probability
theory and machine learning allowed the creation of agents that could make decisions under
uncertainty to attain the best expected outcome.     

In a nutshell, AI has focused on the study
and construction of agents that do the right thing. What counts as the right thing is defined
by the objective that we provide to the agent. This general paradigm is so pervasive that we
might call it the standard model.
