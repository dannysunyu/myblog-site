这本书是我见过质量最好的Spring入门书籍，真的是没有之一。

一直很稀奇，为何Spring这个流行的框架，社区中没有产出香Rails Tutorials那么高质量的入门实作读物。

此外，作者有些书目的推荐。

# 微服务

> Software architecture and its evolution is such a fantastic and complex subject. I don’t think there’ll ever be too many books to cover this subject thoroughly. I’ve added this discussion to the book to help you understand the references I’ll make to these notions. Still, you might want to go deeper into the subjects, so here’s a list of books from my shelf. The books are in the order I recommend you read them.

1. Microservices in Action
2. Microservices Patterns
3. Spring Microservices in Action
4. Microservices Security in Action
5. Monolith to Microservices
