这是记录我学习的Open Full Stack上的一门小课程[**Part 13 - Using relational databases**](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part13)。

这本课程是用[**PostgreSQL**](https://www.postgresql.org/)。

这里首先讲到之前课程用到的MongoDB。

> Mongo is a document database and one of its most characteristic features is that it is schemaless, i.e. the database has only a very limited awareness of what kind of data is stored in its collections. The schema of the database exists only in the program code, which interprets the data in a specific way, e.g. by identifying that some of the fields are references to objects in another collection.
