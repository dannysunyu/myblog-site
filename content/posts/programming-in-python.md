Lists are an extension of an earlier, more primitive concept called **arrays**.

An older programming concept called a **record**, which is any data structure that combines several distinct values into
an integrated whole.

The individual components of a record are generally called **fields**.

The simplest way to represent a record in Python is to use a built-in data structure called **tuple**, which is used in both computer science and mathematics to refer to an
ordered, immutable collection of elements.

As it happens, Python programmers rarely refer to the elements of a tuple by their
index number because the language offers a convenient syntactic form called
**destructuring assignment** for splitting a tuple into its component elements.

Encode the information for each record as an object containing the
necessary fields, which are more often called **attributes** in the context of a Python
object.

In Python, having a reference to an object makes it possible to create new attributes within it.
