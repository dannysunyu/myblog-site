[Postgres官网](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html)对psql的介绍：
>**psql** is a terminal-based front-end to PostgreSQL. It enables you to type in queries interactively, issue them to 
> PostgreSQL, and see the query results. Alternatively, input can be from a file or from command line arguments. 
> In addition, psql provides a number of meta-commands and various shell-like features to facilitate writing scripts
> and automating a wide variety of tasks.
