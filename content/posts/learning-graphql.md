# [The GraphQL-First Philosophy](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/tools/docs/introduction#the-graphql-first-philosophy)

>A specific workflow for developing a GraphQL server, where the GraphQL schema is the first thing you design, and acts 
> as the contract between your frontend and backend. It’s not necessarily for everyone, but it can be a great way to get
> a server up and running with a very clear separation of concerns.
